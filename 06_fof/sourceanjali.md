I am ever flying into truer blue and brighter light 

Clear haze

I have been taking part in the inconsistent practice of trying to see my own vision

I will focus on atmosphere’s expanse until my eyes water and I clutch your elbow from wonder and imbalance 
I am trying to invert my gaze onto/into myself, or perhaps witness how my eyes are drawing their surroundings in, and witness what debris they project out

I have to cement the image in memory. 
A pale glow but a sharp outline, rectangular but meandering along a river, or a road, something with yellow lights. Pale yellow lights that must be so, so bright, to see them from here, in all this blue fog.
When I catch a glimpse of light I focus on it—stare at it—keep it captured in my vision until this ever-deepening blue haze takes them (before my eyes can catch up to the lack of human light)
And continue looking past the expanse
Past the point when I know for certain my eyes aren’t imagining things
(Imagining light spots where I think they should exist)
Now it’s just blue
Now I get to watch blue disappear 

Once again I get to see definition 
See where one stops and the other begins
See true blue and a color I can’t figure out
This must be it
To look at the ground against blue and identify it as such
I’ve learned that lightning is a true peach pink against gray and blue
It illuminates clouds in a tremor of sweetness
It makes my left eye look inward
And focus on involuntary movement 

How can I sleep a wink
If all this is here for me to see
Even in darkness
If looking up, across, down, out is all the same
If I see spots of light above that mirror those below
They’re the same,
And they’re split by a color (by a distance) I can’t identify 
With every move I grow farther from pink lightning
And with every strike it illuminates detail that crosses an unfathomable distance 
It denies the horizon
It undoes the compression of space that night has invoked 
It reminds me of distance
And keeps my sense of scale and time somewhat intact

I see we’re passing the cross
A long line lost to distance
The lightning is quiet now
I’m far
I have to watch closely
I have to make sure I see it disappear 
I am aware of the separation between earthly medium
I’m craning my body and mind to watch it pass behind me
Perhaps I will fear forever
And perhaps I will move
Not by any choice of mine, but a flow of air
Powerful invisibility and mechanical fuel will keep me moving towards something I cannot see before me and vaguely know the name of.
The stars are close to land
I still see flashes of pink 
In this color I can’t name
And the horizon leaves, again, gently into darkness and lines that only my eyes can see

Below there are little circles of light
Little circles made of dots
And clusters of warmth 
They get fuzzy
I don’t understand the color when they become fuzzy
I understand that notion, that color is degrees of light. Darkness is a degree of color. The lightning is gone, not because it stopped, but because I got too far to keep following it. It’s somewhere behind me, like deer and sounds and light that fades into pure color. Maybe the light no longer has color. Maybe the light has lost the quality that makes it light. Maybe this sensation I’m taking in is just one of form—shape, color. Once the blanket comes, I’m not sure luminosity exists anymore. I don’t know the difference between light and contrast. Will differing color always mean light? Will seeing a contrast always mean that illumination is just within reach? How do I identify which color is the lighter one—I can’t keep my mind from parsing it out—it seems written in my eye. 
I have many questions for these lines in the dark, and for unidentifiable colors. 

If I don’t try, it’s all one and black 
This kind of light is impossible to paint
These colors don’t exist in the flat and physical
It’s all suspended in space
And degrees of what my eyes can see
Something speaks to me in gray 

I missed the transition from black to black
True darkness cannot be identified until it exists
I suspect this isn’t true, either
I can see pinpoint-glow networks that break the expanse

A long intermission
The most identifiable clear darkness so far. This is black. I know it so
I still see pale streaks on a horizon that doesn’t exist
There are more stars now
There’s life below, and by the light, I know it so
These networks aren’t sparse, they aren’t few
There are too many for me to pick one to watch disappear
They are continuously intersecting webs
This darkness is planar 
I see strict grids in a larger cluster
I wonder what its name is
The stars are everywhere below me
I see gaps

There’s a curved border of light near what I would guess is the horizon 
I wonder if it’s water that’s being illuminated 
I don’t know why I hope that it is

We approach an orange dusk that allows for more identifiable color than I have seen in some time
This, perhaps, is a sprawling cluster unique to itself
How can it shine like this—
Contained, ending, stretching out and hovering slightly above
Horizon exists beyond 
Stay close to the ground 
Press your belly to the light 
Let me feel it
Think of darkness and silence the same way
If light and sound are foils, darkness meets quiet

Haze removes space again
There is peace to immediacy 
And peace to vivid flatness
It’s a treat to feel both 

There are so many stars
The clouds that pass below are black on top, lit gray from the bottom 
Language-less shrouds so far above 

I meet lightning again
It thuds white against this indecipherable black, in gray 

It is very black out
The absence of light makes it hard to see the surface of my vision 

I can see airbrushed spots of some kind of white in the black below me
I see streaks along what should be horizon, and people stand there too
The stars are crisp as ever
Cloud spots remind me of looking at the ocean—
There are sections that shimmer, unbroken skin
Spots that don’t reflect light, that seem some solid and matte
My guess is that it’s all cloud
The darkness below
The spots of white
My guess is that it’s a haze of water, water that seeks to be less straightforward than its brother at sea

The afternoon has brightened up at last
For rain is falling, sudden and minute.
Falling or fallen. There is no dispute:
Rain is a thing that happens in the past.

Who hears it fall retrieves a time that fled
When an uncanny windfall could disclose
To him a flower by the name of rose
And the perplexing redness of its red.

Falling until it blinds each windowpane,
Within a suburb now long lost this rain
Shall liven black grapes on a vine inside

A certain patio that is no more.
A long-awaited voice through the downpour
Is from my father. He has never died.

i
have
atheory
about
how
the
world
works
i'm just not sure
how to prove it yet
i wouldn't know who to tell
anyways
or if they'd get it
or if it's true
i often think about that time i told you
you said you didn't understand
how birds are ears
and
i'm a hand
i'd do great things
if you believed in the me that believed the sky would cry
if the world was hard
but underneath the brightest sun
my body aches the kindest sore
and bathing deeply in its light
i know for now
my theory's right
